BigVGA
======

WARNING: this is still at the work-in-progres proof-of-concept stage.

BigVGA library and command-line tool to set high-resolution text modes in
FreeDOS and other DOS-compatible systems.

Unlike other projects that rely on SuperVGA hardware, BigVGA only uses basic
VGA features.

The main target is emulators (e.g. qemu, dosbox, dosemu, bochs...) but it might
also work on some laptops or LCD screens.

BigVGA is free software, released under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file
for details.
